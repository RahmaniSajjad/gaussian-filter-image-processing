# gaussian-filter-image-processing
This repository contains a Python script that applies a Gaussian filter to an input image using a convolution operation. The script splits the input image into its RGB channels, applies the filter to each channel separately, and then merges the filtered channels back into a single image. The filtered image is then downsampled and saved to disk.
